Welcome to the **InkMD Assets** repository. This is the centralized resource hub for the **InkMD** application. It houses all static assets and design templates required to maintain the aesthetic consistency and functionality of the InkMD app.

The repository is meticulously organized to separate UI components from content templates:

### 1. 🔹 `/Icons` : 
Contains all the icons for users to display on their .md file. 

### 2. 📝 `/Templates`
A comprehensive set of predefined Markdown (`.md`) templates designed to supercharge your writing workflow.  

# If you want a new icon / template feel free to create a issue 🥰.
